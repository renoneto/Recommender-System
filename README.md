# Movie Recommender :clapper:

In this project, I'm creating a movie recommender model using the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) and deploying it. You can find more information about the model in the [Jupyter notebook]() and [you can see the app by clicking here](https://movie-recommender-reno.herokuapp.com/).

## Business Case and Goal

I was hired to create a model to provide 5 movie recommendations to users and I need to deal with the **cold start** problem (when it's a brand new user with no ratings in the database).

## The Dataset

The MovieLens dataset is a "classic" recommendation system dataset used in numerous academic papers and machine learning proofs-of-concept.
